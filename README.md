Student Loans: Higher education is placing students into debt each year. Whether it be an under-grad, graduate, or post graduate work, graduating students are facing long term student loan debt. Utilizing nces.ed.gov, Education Data Initiative and Federal Student Aid websites. We will answer these three questions to identify the impact of student loans on the population.
1. Does the student loan population feel more pressure on their financial situation if they were to have secured student loans from a private bank versus the federal student loan sector? 
2. What is the average student loan per student across America?
3. How does the cost of tuition influence national student debt over time
