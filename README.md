Student Loans: Higher education is placing students into debt each year. Whether it be a technical degree, under-grad, graduate, or post graduate work, graduating students are facing long term student loan debt. Utilizing nces.ed.gov, Education Data Initiative and Federal Student Aid websites. We will answer these three questions to identify the impact of student loans on the population.

1. What age and location type are most impacted by student debt?
2. How much has been borrowed?
3. How many students have taken out loans from 2007 to 2022?
4. What is the average cost of tuition relative to the average amount of student debt for a 4-year university?
