Student Loans: Higher education is placing students into debt each year. Whether it be a technical degree, undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate work, graduating students are facing long-term student loan debt. Utilizing nces.ed.gov, Education Data Initiative, and Federal Student Aid websites. We will answer these three questions to identify the impact of student loans on the population.

Our Questions For This Project:

1. What age and location type are most impacted by student debt?
2. How much has been borrowed each year from 2007 to 2022; how many students have taken out loans each year from 2007 to 2022?
3. What is the average cost of tuition relative to the average amount of student debt for a 4-year university?

Analysis and Conclusion:

1. What age and location type are most impacted by student debt?
    The data used for this project represents different age groups and their corresponding debt size, dollars outstanding, and number of borrowers. It can help us analyze trends and patterns in student loans across different age ranges. We can observe some trends. It seems that as age increases, both the debt size and dollars outstanding tend to increase. Additionally, the number of borrowers also tends to be higher in older age groups. This suggests that older individuals may have larger student loan debts compared to younger age groups.
From the data we can conclude the average student loan debt ranged from 20-40k in ages 65 and older. From the data, we can also see that the highest debt size and dollars outstanding are in the 35 to 49 age group. This age group has the highest values in both categories compared to the other age groups. It seems that individuals in their late 30s to early 50s tend to have the highest student loan debts.

2. How much has been borrowed each year from 2007 to 2022; how many students have taken out loans each year from 2007 to 2022?
    The three visuals provided offer insight into various aspects of student loans specifically, Direct Loans, FFEL (Federal Family Education Loan Program), and Perkins Loans over different years. 
a. Total Dollars and Total Recipients Over the Years (DL, FFEL, Perkin):
    The bar graph showcases the total amount of money borrowed and the total number of recipients for each year from 2006 to 2022. The exact figures are not provided, but you can observe general trends.
There's a consistent rise in the total number of recipients from 2012 onwards.
The amount borrowed seems to be somewhat stable from 2012 to 2022, with slight variations.
b. Loan Recipients Over the Years:
    The line graph displays the number of recipients for each type of loan across the years.
Direct Loans have seen a steady increase in recipients from 2010 onwards.
FFEL recipients peaked around 2010 and have been declining ever since.
Perkins Loan recipients remain relatively stable but at a much lower number compared to the other two.
c. Distribution of Direct Loans, FFEL, and Perkins Loans over the years:
    This pie chart gives the percentage distribution of the three types of loans.
Direct Loans dominate, constituting 73.1% of the total.
FFEL loans make up 26.4%.
Perkins Loans are a minuscule portion, making up only 0.6%.
Conclusion
    In 2013, there has been a noticeable uptick in students seeking financial assistance. Post-2019, available funds sufficiently addressed the financial requirements of students. While FFEL and Perkins contribute to the loan landscape, over 70% of the disbursements originate from Federal Direct Loans.

3. What is the average cost of tuition relative to the average amount of student debt for a 4-year university? 
    Over the last 60 years, we have seen an exponential increase in the cost of higher education. The average academic year costs for tuition, fees, room, and board were $11,760 in 1963 and $30,031 in 2022. That is a staggering 155% increase in average tuition costs. In addition, we can see that there is a trend of increase in people having to take out student loans. Not only is there an increase in the number of borrowers as time goes on but more and more people are having to take out higher loans. We can also see a decrease in the number of borrowers who are taking out loans less than $5,000, as this amount is no longer enough to cover tuition costs. This in turn is causing an increase in the outstanding dollar amount of student debt and continues to perpetuate the national student loan crisis.
